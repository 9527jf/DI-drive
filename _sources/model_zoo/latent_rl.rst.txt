Latent Reinforcement Learning is a category of policy settings which generate
latent representations that can conpletely characterize the features related to
the task in the input observation. Techically, it uses a Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to get latent embeddings, and use it to train RL policies.

Our implementation refers to `Model-free RL for AD <https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09503>`_
with **DI-drive** and **DI-engine** and transfers it to more general cases. In the
following documents, it will be explained detailly.
